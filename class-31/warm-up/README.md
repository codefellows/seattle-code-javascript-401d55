# Warm Up - Rotators

Rotators / Carousels are a classic on modern websites. Often used in the "Hero" portion of the website for big bold calls to action, they're also quite useful on mobile to give the users a "swipe" interface to go through items in a familiar UX

## Overview

A rotator, or carousel is generally thought of as a series of `<img >` or `<div >` that show/hide in some sort of order, allowing the user to change between them,  generally with either a call to action button or being entirely click-able.

For this challenge, we're going to create a carousel using **cards** for each "slide" and a **deck** as the container

## Challenge

Create a carousel similar to the one above

- Use Cards and Decks
- The `.deck` is an element that wraps a list of cards
- Apply a class of `rotator`to the deck to achieve the desired UI
- Each `.card` is the content shown as it "rotates" or "slides in"
- Cards should either have a button to click or be entirely clickable
  - Perhaps, a class on the card (as previously built) can inform this

> Can you do this entirely with CSS?
> If you need Javascript, use as little as possible, and use VanillaJS, not jQuery
