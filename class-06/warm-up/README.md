# Warm Up - Cards

## Overview

One of the newest design patterns for modern websites is the use of "Cards" and "Decks"

A **Card** is the visual representation (markup) of structured content (data).

**Content**, or a "piece of content" is typically described as the common and core set of information used to describe **one** thing:

- Title
- Copy
- Media (images or video)
- Links

By default, cards should show their content vertically stacked, as shown below, so that they are "responsive" out of the box. As you discover more ways to lay out the card elements, you'll likely always revert to this core layout as your responsive base.

## Challenge

1. Create a set of rules for describing the core card content data as markup
   - e.g. What elements will you use for the card container itself? The title? Image?
1. Using CSS (or SASS), implement styling rules to lay out a card in a stacked, responsive manner, similar to the example

### Notes

Cards can come in many shapes and sizes. Images can be above, below, or alongside the content or even as the background for the card itself. The text can be hidden, pinned to the bottom, or wrapping the image. There can be more than one link (and they may bear higher importance). Consider the edge cases (and the possibilities!) as you conceptualize your markup rules and your first CSS ruleset for cards.
