# JavaScript 401 Warm-Up - DSA Practice

## Setup

* Work in a repository for this warmup exercise (`warmup-dsa`)
  * On each day, create a new folder and branch of this repo with the date
    * i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`
  * Submit a PR from that branch to your master for review
  * If you are deploying to a cloud hosting service, provide that link as well
  * Timebox this to 1 hour

## Warm-Up Exercise

**Before You Start** ... complete the [daily warm-up](../warmup-daily)

The goal of this set of drills is to create muscle memory in the core operations that allow you to inspect the data in each data structure. Most DS&A interview questions begin with your having this basic tool at your disposal, with the "real challenge" being which data structure is the best choice, and what evaluations are being made as you traverse and iterate.

*Only complete the tasks below for the data structures you have been taught. Each week, this assignment will organically grow.*

**You may use your `data-structures-and-algorithms` implementation to setup your data structures and put data into them. This assignment is solely to practice iteration and traversals**

For each structure below, create a new file called `practice-[ds].js` and require the appropriate data structure implementation as needed. Then, code out each of the following requirements by hand.

* Process a Queue and a Stack in the correct order
  * `practice-stack.js',`practice-queue.js`
* Iterate a linked list, printing out the values
  * `practice-linked-list.js`
* Traverse a Binary Tree, printing out the values as you visit each node.
  * `practice-trees.js`
  * Breath First
  * Depth First: Pre-Order
  * Depth First: In-Order
  * Depth First: Post-Order
* Traverse a Graph, printing out the value on each vertex as you visit
  * `practice-graph.js`
  * Breadth First
  * Depth First
* Write QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort functions for an array
  * `practice-sorting.js`
