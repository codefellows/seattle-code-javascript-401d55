# JavaScript 401 Warm-Up - Async

## Setup

* Work in a repository for this warmup exercise (`warmup-async`)
  * On each day, create a new folder and branch of this repo with the date
    * i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`
  * Submit a PR from that branch to your master for review
  * If you are deploying to a cloud hosting service, provide that link as well
  * Timebox this to 1 hour

## Warm-Up Exercises

**Before You Start** ... complete the [daily warm-up](../warmup-daily)

This exercise is designed to ensure that you have a solid grasp on async programming in javascript as well as to re-use some of core programming concepts of the language and managing basic data structures.

* Write a function called `fetchPeopleWithPromises()` that will:
  * Use superagent to load content from the Star Wars API
    * <https://swapi.co/api/people/>
  * Reduce the results array (an array of people objects) into an simpler array of urls from the person's `url` property
  * Go through that array, fetching each person's data with superagent, building up an array of promises
  * Use promise.all to collect all of the responses at once.
  * When all of the promises have resolved, print a list of each person's name

* Repeat the process, but this time using a function called `fetchPeopleWithAsync()` which uses async and await to return you a list of people
