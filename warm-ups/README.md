# 401 Advanced Javascript - Daily Warm-Up Exercises

Build muscle memory on some the core fundamentals of the language and as a front-end.

## In-Class Warm-Ups

- 15-20 minutes of small group work to solve the "challenge" of the day
- 10 minutes of the instructor being "navigated" by the class
- As a class, the code written will become part of the class repository for all students to reference and share

The in-class warm-ups will take the class through building two sets of front end tools.

### A Javascript library (similar to lodash) called **shredder**

Build this library function by function each class day, with the intent being to revisit fundamentals of basic data structures (arrays, objects) and even explore how jQuery and Ajax work under the hood, and remain in touch with the core language while exploring the deeper builds that the 401 labs go into. This library, when complete, will contain functions such as:

- `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.has()` for arrays and objects
- `render()` a template (like mustache)
- `.get()`, `.post()`, `.put()`, `.delete()` to perform ajax-like operations
- jQuery like syntax for finding elements and adding events, reading props, etc

### A CSS "framework" where they'll write reusable CSS modules with the intent being they can use these CSS snippets/classes in any project. They will build the HTML and CSS for such things as:

- Drop down menus
- Hamburger menus
- Cards & Decks
- Grid layouts
- Form Fields

## Post Graduation Warm-Ups

To stay "in touch" with code and the basics ... each day, you should complete each of the below warm-ups:

### [Daily Warmup](./daily/)

- Work with arrays, functions, looping, and objects.  Implement spread, deconstruction techniques along with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### [The Holy Grail](./holy-grail/)

- Implement the "Holy Grail" web layout using Float, Flexbox, and Grid, adding some "flavor" on each subsequent iteration.

### [Async](./async/)

- One of the biggest strengths of Javascript is its use of and prowess at asynchronous actions. At the core of this is Promises and async/await.
- This challenge will have students using Promises and Async to fetch and transform remote dataâ€”actions which are done daily in production level work.

### [Express Server](./express/)

- A qualified JS developer should be able to produce an express server "on demand". This warm-up will have students creating a basic Express server, using TDD which utilizes the core Express components (`get`, `post`, EJS, middleware).

### [React](./react/)

- As a full-stack developer, you should be in constant touch with your front end application building skills. in this warmup, you'll write a React To Do application that utilizes multiple state management tactics and enzyme tests.

### [Data Structures](./dsa/)

- Every data structure has at its base, a means of traversal. Every data structure challenge/question/interview has at its base a requirement that you "do something" while traversing.
- This warm-up exercise is intended to make the traversals trivial so that students can focus solely on the logic that occurs during traversals to solve challenges.
