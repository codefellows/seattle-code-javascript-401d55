# storefront

## Introduction

This is a basic React application for a storefront. It uses Redux for state management and Material UI for components and styling. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`


## Phase 1: Application Setup

This phase involves setting up a basic React application with the following features:

- Redux for state management: This allows us to manage the state of the application in memory, providing a single source of truth for the entire application.
- Material UI for components and styling: This provides a set of ready-to-use components that follow the Material Design guidelines, allowing us to create a consistent and attractive user interface with minimal effort.
- I used the review from today to build out the app; original code by Samaad and Jacob
